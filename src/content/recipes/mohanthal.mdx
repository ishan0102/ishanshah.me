*Mohanthal*

A rich besan sweet roasted in ghee, cooled before adding sugar, then shaped and set.

## Ingredients

- 2 bowls Chickpea flour (besan)
- 1/2 bowl Coarse wheat flour
- Ghee (for roasting)
- Sugar (added after cooling (quantity not specified))
- Cardamom (added after sugar (quantity not specified))

## Instructions

1. Roast the besan (and coarse wheat flour) in ghee until the color changes.
2. Remove and spread on a plate to cool.
3. After it cools, add sugar (adding sugar while hot may release water).
4. Add cardamom.
5. Form into balls, press into a plate, and let it set.

## Tips

- Add sugar only after the mixture cools; otherwise the sugar will release water.
