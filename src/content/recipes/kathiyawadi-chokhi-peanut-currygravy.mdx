# Kathiyawadi Chokhi (Peanut Curry/Gravy)

Kathiyawadi-style peanut-based gravy cooked with onions, tomatoes, spices, and herbs, then simmered; boiled peanuts and potato are used to build body and thickness.

## Ingredients

- 3 onions (plus 'chopped onion' mentioned later)
- 1 tomato
- potato (boiled; also used to thicken gravy)
- green chilies
- coriander leaves
- ginger
- garlic
- peanut powder (added after grinding)
- peanuts (soaked, then cooked in pressure cooker)
- coriander powder
- red chili powder
- salt (includes 1 tsp salt while pressure cooking peanuts)
- garam masala
- oil (for gravy)
- asafoetida (hing) (for gravy)
- water (for cooking peanuts and adjusting gravy consistency)

## Instructions

1. Soak peanuts (soaking overnight is better).
2. Pressure cook the peanuts with enough water and about 1 tsp salt; cook for 5–6 whistles, lowering the gas after 4 whistles and completing the remaining whistles on slow flame.
3. To make the gravy, heat oil and add hing.
4. Add onions and sauté until brown.
5. Add tomatoes, then add the spices (coriander powder, red chili powder, garam masala, salt).
6. Add a little water and add the boiled potatoes.
7. Add chopped onion, green chilies, coriander, and salt.
8. Crush/blend the mixture in a mixer.
9. Add the crushed peanuts (and/or peanut powder).
10. Cook the gravy after blending; add water if needed to adjust consistency.
11. Simmer on slow gas for 10 minutes.

## Tips

- If peanuts are soaked the previous night, it will be better.
- If you add boiled potato, the gravy becomes thick.
- After crushing in the mixer, cook the gravy and add water if needed.
- Simmer on slow gas for 10 minutes.
