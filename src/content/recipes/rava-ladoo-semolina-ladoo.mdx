# Rava Ladoo (Semolina Ladoo)
*Rava na Ladoo*

Semolina ladoos made by mixing roasted rava with a hot 2-string sugar syrup and shaping into balls.

## Ingredients

- 1 bowl semolina (rava)
- ghee (approx.; for roasting)
- 1 bowl khoya
- 2 bowls sugar (used with water for syrup)
- 2 bowls water (used with sugar for syrup (as written))
- cardamom powder

## Instructions

1. Roast rava in ghee and keep aside.
2. Add cardamom powder to the roasted rava.
3. In a pan, combine khoya with sugar and water and cook on high heat to make a thick 2-string syrup.
4. Check syrup consistency: a drop in water forms 1 string, then 2 strings; when 2 strings form, it is ready.
5. While the syrup is hot, add the roasted rava.
6. After 5 minutes, shape the mixture into balls (ladoo).

## Tips

- Make the syrup on high heat and ensure it reaches a 2-string consistency before mixing.
