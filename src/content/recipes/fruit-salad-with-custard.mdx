# Fruit Salad with Custard

A simple milk custard base cooled and chilled, then mixed with fresh fruits shortly before serving.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 liter milk
- sugar (to taste)
- 2 tsp custard powder (mixed into reserved milk)
- mixed fruits (e.g., apple, banana, pomegranate; add 1–2 hours before serving)

## Instructions

1. Boil the milk with sugar.
2. Remove about 1/2 bowl/cup of milk and set aside.
3. Mix custard powder into the reserved milk and dissolve well.
4. Add this mixture back into the boiling milk and stir.
5. When it thickens, turn off the heat.
6. Stir for 5–10 minutes so it doesn’t form lumps.
7. Cool completely, then chill in the freezer.
8. Add fruits 1–2 hours before serving.

## Tips

- Stir 5–10 minutes after turning off heat to prevent lumps.
- Add fruits shortly before serving (1–2 hours) to avoid them turning soggy.
