# Spinach in Kathiyawadi Gravy (Palak)
*Palak*

Spinach cooked in the same peanut-onion-tomato gravy as Kathiyawadi Chokhi, finished with ghee.

## Ingredients

- spinach
- oil (for tempering)
- asafoetida (hing) (for tempering)
- ghee (add a little when it boils)

## Instructions

1. Prepare the same gravy as Kathiyawadi Chokhi.
2. Add spinach to the gravy.
3. If you choose to crush the gravy in a mixer, also crush the spinach.
4. When it comes to a boil, add a little ghee.
5. For tempering, use oil and asafoetida as needed.

## Tips

- If it becomes too watery, make a thin, lump-free paste of chickpea flour (besan) with a little water and add it to the gravy; do not blend in the mixer—boil to thicken.
