# Rasgulla
*Rasgulla*

Soft paneer balls cooked in sugar syrup using a pressure cooker method, then soaked to absorb syrup.

## Ingredients

- 1 litre cow’s milk
- 1 lemon lemon juice (juice; diluted with equal water)
- water (equal amount to lemon juice (for curdling) + double water for sugar syrup + hot water after cooking as needed)
- 250 gm sugar (also written as 2 bowls)

## Instructions

1. Boil the milk.
2. Dilute the lemon juice with an equal amount of water.
3. Stir the milk and slowly add the diluted lemon juice to curdle it.
4. Drain completely to obtain paneer (chhena).
5. In a cooker, combine sugar with double the water and bring to a boil.
6. While the syrup comes to a boil, knead the paneer while slightly hot until very soft; form small balls.
7. When the syrup boils, add paneer balls one by one.
8. Close the cooker and cook; open after two whistles.
9. After opening, add hot water so the paneer balls do not stick together.
10. For better soaking, leave in the cooker from afternoon till night.
11. If opening the cooker the next day, add water, cover, simmer for 10 minutes, then serve.

## Tips

- Leaving rasgullas in the cooker/syrup longer helps them soak up syrup.
- Keeps 7–8 days in the fridge.
- Add hot water after pressure cooking to prevent balls from sticking.
