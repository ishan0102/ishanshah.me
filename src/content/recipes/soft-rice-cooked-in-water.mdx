# Soft Rice Cooked in Water

Basic method for cooking rice in boiling water until soft, then optionally draining the water.

## Ingredients

- water (large vessel; amount not specified)
- rice (soaked or unsoaked)
- salt (as needed)

## Instructions

1. Heat water in a large vessel until it comes to a boil.
2. Add rice (soaked rice will cook faster; unsoaked rice will take longer).
3. Add salt as needed.
4. Cook on medium/slow flame for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until rice is soft.
5. Turn off the heat.
6. If desired, strain/drain the water; otherwise keep rice with water as desired.

## Tips

- Soaked rice cooks faster than unsoaked rice.
- You may strain the rice or keep the cooking water, as desired.
